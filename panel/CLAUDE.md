# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Ploi Core is a Laravel-based webhosting management platform that allows users to launch their own webhosting service using ploi.io as the backend infrastructure.

## Essential Commands

# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# Format PHP code
composer format

# Run tests
php artisan test
php artisan test --filter=TestName

# Run browser tests
php artisan dusk

# Clear all caches

```

### Database
```bash
# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Rollback migrations
php artisan migrate:rollback

# Fresh migration with seeders
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Custom Artisan Commands
```bash
php artisan core:install      # Initial installation
php artisan core:synchronize  # Sync with Ploi API
php artisan core:cleanup      # Clean up resources
php artisan core:trial        # Manage trials
```

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+), Filament v4 admin panel
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Queue**: Laravel Horizon with Redis
- **Payments**: Laravel Cashier (Stripe)
- **Testing**: Pest PHP, Laravel Dusk

### Key Directories
- `app/Services/Ploi/` - Ploi.io API integration layer
- `app/Filament/` - Admin panel resources and pages
- `app/Http/Controllers/` - Web and API controllers
- `app/Jobs/` - Async queue jobs for Ploi API operations
- `resources/js/Pages/` - Inertia.js Vue pages
- `resources/js/components/` - Reusable Vue components

### Ploi API Integration
The application heavily integrates with the Ploi.io API. Key service class is at `app/Services/Ploi/Ploi.php`. All server/site management operations go through this API layer. Use queue jobs for long-running operations to avoid timeouts.

### Database Structure
Main entities: Users, Packages, Servers, Sites, Databases, Certificates, Cronjobs. Multi-tenancy through user-server-site relationships. Role-based access: admin, reseller, user.

### Frontend Architecture
- Inertia.js handles the Vue-Laravel bridge
- Pages are in `resources/js/Pages/` following Laravel route structure
- Shared data is passed via Inertia middleware
- Vuex store modules in `resources/js/store/`
- Form handling uses Inertia forms

### Testing Approach
- Feature tests use Pest PHP syntax
- Database tests use RefreshDatabase trait
- API calls should be mocked using Http::fake()
- Browser tests in `tests/Browser/` using Dusk

### Important Environment Variables
```
PLOI_TOKEN=            # Ploi API token
APP_DEMO=false         # Demo mode toggle
STRIPE_KEY=            # Stripe public key
STRIPE_SECRET=         # Stripe secret key
```

### Development Workflow
1. Always run `npm run dev` for frontend changes
2. Use queue workers for Ploi API operations
3. Clear caches when changing config or routes
4. Format code with `composer format` before commits
5. Test with `php artisan test` for unit/feature tests

### Common Patterns
- Use Actions (`app/Actions/`) for business logic
- API responses follow Laravel's resource pattern
- Filament resources handle admin CRUD operations
- Queue jobs for async Ploi API calls
- Service classes for external integrations

### Deployment
Production deployment uses the `update.sh` script which handles git pull, composer install, migrations, and cache clearing. Laravel Horizon manages queues in production.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.5.7
- filament/filament (FILAMENT) - v4
- inertiajs/inertia-laravel (INERTIA) - v2
- laravel/cashier (CASHIER) - v15
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/horizon (HORIZON) - v5
- laravel/octane (OCTANE) - v2
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v3
- tightenco/ziggy (ZIGGY) - v1
- laravel/dusk (DUSK) - v8
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v3
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- @inertiajs/vue3 (INERTIA) - v2
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4
- vue (VUE) - v3

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches when dealing with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The `search-docs` tool is perfect for all Laravel-related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something very complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

## Inertia

- Inertia.js components should be placed in the `resources/js/Pages` directory unless specified differently in the JS bundler (`vite.config.js`).
- Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of traditional Blade views.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for accurate guidance on all things Inertia.

<code-snippet name="Inertia Render Example" lang="php">
// routes/web.php example
Route::get('/users', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
        'users' => User::all()
    ]);
});
</code-snippet>

=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

## Inertia v2

- Make use of all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making any changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.

### Inertia v2 New Features
- Deferred props.
- Infinite scrolling using merging props and `WhenVisible`.
- Lazy loading data on scroll.
- Polling.
- Prefetching.

### Deferred Props & Empty States
- When using deferred props on the frontend, you should add a nice empty state with pulsing/animated skeleton.

### Inertia Form General Guidance
- Build forms using the `useForm` helper. Use the code examples and the `search-docs` tool with a query of `useForm helper` for guidance.

=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version-specific documentation.
- This project upgraded from Laravel 10 without migrating to the new streamlined Laravel file structure.
- This is **perfectly fine** and recommended by Laravel. Follow the existing structure from Laravel 10. We do not need to migrate to the new Laravel structure unless the user explicitly requests it.

### Laravel 10 Structure
- Middleware typically lives in `app/Http/Middleware/` and service providers in `app/Providers/`.
- There is no `bootstrap/app.php` application configuration in a Laravel 10 structure:
    - Middleware registration happens in `app/Http/Kernel.php`
    - Exception handling is in `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`
    - Console commands and schedule register in `app/Console/Kernel.php`
    - Rate limits likely exist in `RouteServiceProvider` or `app/Http/Kernel.php`

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== livewire/core rules ===

## Livewire

- Use the `search-docs` tool to find exact version-specific documentation for how to write Livewire and Livewire tests.
- Use the `php artisan make:livewire [Posts\CreatePost]` Artisan command to create new components.
- State should live on the server, with the UI reflecting it.
- All Livewire requests hit the Laravel backend; they're like regular HTTP requests. Always validate form data and run authorization checks in Livewire actions.

## Livewire Best Practices
- Livewire components require a single root element.
- Use `wire:loading` and `wire:dirty` for delightful loading states.
- Add `wire:key` in loops:

    ```blade
    @foreach ($items as $item)
        <div wire:key="item-{{ $item->id }}">
            {{ $item->name }}
        </div>
    @endforeach
    ```

- Prefer lifecycle hooks like `mount()`, `updatedFoo()` for initialization and reactive side effects:

<code-snippet name="Lifecycle Hook Examples" lang="php">
    public function mount(User $user) { $this->user = $user; }
    public function updatedSearch() { $this->resetPage(); }
</code-snippet>

## Testing Livewire

<code-snippet name="Example Livewire Component Test" lang="php">
    Livewire::test(Counter::class)
        ->assertSet('count', 0)
        ->call('increment')
        ->assertSet('count', 1)
        ->assertSee(1)
        ->assertStatus(200);
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Livewire Component Exists on Page" lang="php">
    $this->get('/posts/create')
    ->assertSeeLivewire(CreatePost::class);
</code-snippet>

=== livewire/v3 rules ===

## Livewire 3

### Key Changes From Livewire 2
- These things changed in Livewire 3, but may not have been updated in this application. Verify this application's setup to ensure you conform with application conventions.
    - Use `wire:model.live` for real-time updates, `wire:model` is now deferred by default.
    - Components now use the `App\Livewire` namespace (not `App\Http\Livewire`).
    - Use `$this->dispatch()` to dispatch events (not `emit` or `dispatchBrowserEvent`).
    - Use the `components.layouts.app` view as the typical layout path (not `layouts.app`).

### New Directives
- `wire:show`, `wire:transition`, `wire:cloak`, `wire:offline`, `wire:target` are available for use. Use the documentation to find usage examples.

### Alpine
- Alpine is now included with Livewire; don't manually include Alpine.js.
- Plugins included with Alpine: persist, intersect, collapse, and focus.

### Lifecycle Hooks
- You can listen for `livewire:init` to hook into Livewire initialization, and `fail.status === 419` for the page expiring:

<code-snippet name="Livewire Init Hook Example" lang="js">
document.addEventListener('livewire:init', function () {
    Livewire.hook('request', ({ fail }) => {
        if (fail && fail.status === 419) {
            alert('Your session expired');
        }
    });

    Livewire.hook('message.failed', (message, component) => {
        console.error(message);
    });
});
</code-snippet>

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest
### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test --compact`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests that have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>

=== inertia-vue/core rules ===

## Inertia + Vue

- Vue components must have a single root element.
- Use `router.visit()` or `<Link>` for navigation instead of traditional links.

<code-snippet name="Inertia Client Navigation" lang="vue">

    import { Link } from '@inertiajs/vue3'
    <Link href="/">Home</Link>

</code-snippet>

=== inertia-vue/v2/forms rules ===

## Inertia v2 + Vue Forms

<code-snippet name="Inertia Vue useForm example" lang="vue">

<script setup>
    import { useForm } from '@inertiajs/vue3'

    const form = useForm({
        email: null,
        password: null,
        remember: false,
    })
</script>

<template>
    <form @submit.prevent="form.post('/login')">
        <!-- email -->
        <input type="text" v-model="form.email">
        <div v-if="form.errors.email">{{ form.errors.email }}</div>
        <!-- password -->
        <input type="password" v-model="form.password">
        <div v-if="form.errors.password">{{ form.errors.password }}</div>
        <!-- remember me -->
        <input type="checkbox" v-model="form.remember"> Remember Me
        <!-- submit -->
        <button type="submit" :disabled="form.processing">Login</button>
    </form>
</template>

</code-snippet>

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML; check and use existing Tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc.).
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults. Remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, and group elements logically.
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing
- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing; don't use margins.

<code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
    <div class="flex gap-8">
        <div>Superior</div>
        <div>Michigan</div>
        <div>Erie</div>
    </div>
</code-snippet>

### Dark Mode
- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.

=== tailwindcss/v4 rules ===

## Tailwind CSS 4

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4; do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.
- In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed.

<code-snippet name="Extending Theme in CSS" lang="css">
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
</code-snippet>

- In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

<code-snippet name="Tailwind v4 Import Tailwind Diff" lang="diff">
   - @tailwind base;
   - @tailwind components;
   - @tailwind utilities;
   + @import "tailwindcss";
</code-snippet>

### Replaced Utilities
- Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option; use the replacement.
- Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated |	Replacement |
|------------+--------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is a Laravel UI framework built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS. UIs are defined in PHP via fluent, chainable components. Follow existing conventions in this app.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices. If `search-docs` is unavailable, refer to https://filamentphp.com/docs.

### Artisan

- Always use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find available commands with the `list-artisan-commands` tool, or run `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options before running, and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Always use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field visibility" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `Set $set` inside `->afterStateUpdated()` on a `->live()` field to mutate another field reactively. Prefer `->live(onBlur: true)` on text inputs to avoid per-keystroke updates:

<code-snippet name="Reactive field update" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->required()
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set(
        'slug',
        Str::slug($state ?? ''),
    )),

TextInput::make('slug')
    ->required(),

</code-snippet>

Compose layout by nesting `Section` and `Grid`. Children need explicit `->columnSpan()` or `->columnSpanFull()`:

<code-snippet name="Section and Grid layout" lang="php">
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Section;

Section::make('Details')
    ->schema([
        Grid::make(2)->schema([
            TextInput::make('first_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('last_name')
                ->columnSpan(1),
            TextInput::make('bio')
                ->columnSpanFull(),
        ]),
    ]),

</code-snippet>

Use `Repeater` for inline `HasMany` management. `->relationship()` with no args binds to the relationship matching the field name:

<code-snippet name="Repeater for HasMany" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('institution')
            ->required(),
        TextInput::make('qualification')
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column value" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Use `SelectFilter` for enum or relationship filters, and `Filter` with a `->query()` closure for custom logic:

<code-snippet name="Table filters" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options(UserStatus::class),

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name'),

Filter::make('verified')
    ->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),

</code-snippet>

Actions are buttons that encapsulate optional modal forms and behavior:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record) => $record->update($data)),

### Testing

Testing setup (requires `pestphp/pest-plugin-livewire` in `composer.json`):

- Always call `$this->actingAs(User::factory()->create())` before testing panel functionality.
- For edit pages, pass `['record' => $user->id]`, use `->call('save')` (not `->call('create')`), and do not assert `->assertRedirect()` (edit pages do not redirect after save).

<code-snippet name="Table test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
    ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
    ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
    ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Create resource test" lang="php">
use function Pest\Laravel\assertDatabaseHas;

livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors()
    ->assertRedirect();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'name' => 'Test',
    'email' => 'test@example.com',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Edit resource test" lang="php">
livewire(EditUser::class, ['record' => $user->id])
    ->fillForm(['name' => 'Updated'])
    ->call('save')
    ->assertNotified()
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
    'id' => $user->id,
    'name' => 'Updated',
]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing validation" lang="php">
livewire(CreateUser::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'name' => null,
        'email' => 'invalid-email',
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasFormErrors([
        'name' => 'required',
        'email' => 'email',
    ])
    ->assertNotNotified();

</code-snippet>

Use `->callAction(DeleteAction::class)` for page actions, or `->callAction(TestAction::make('name')->table($record))` for table actions:

<code-snippet name="Calling actions" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Testing\TestAction;

livewire(ListUsers::class)
    ->callAction(TestAction::make('promote')->table($user), [
        'role' => 'admin',
    ])
    ->assertNotified();

</code-snippet>

### Correct Namespaces

- Form fields (`TextInput`, `Select`, `Repeater`, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (`TextEntry`, `IconEntry`, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (`Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, `Tabs`, `Wizard`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (`Get`, `Set`, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Table columns (`TextColumn`, `IconColumn`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Columns\`
- Table filters (`SelectFilter`, `Filter`, etc.): `Filament\Tables\Filters\`
- Actions (`DeleteAction`, `CreateAction`, etc.): `Filament\Actions\`. Never use `Filament\Tables\Actions\`, `Filament\Forms\Actions\`, or any other sub-namespace for actions.
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

### Common Mistakes

- **Never assume public file visibility.** File visibility is `private` by default. Always use `->visibility('public')` when public access is needed.
- **Never assume full-width layout.** `Grid`, `Section`, `Fieldset`, and `Repeater` do not span all columns by default.
- **Use `Select::make('author_id')->relationship('author', 'name')` for BelongsTo fields.** `BelongsToSelect` does not exist in v4.
- **`Repeater` uses `->schema()`, not `->fields()`.**
- **Never add `->dehydrated(false)` to fields that need to be saved.** It strips the value from form state before `->action()` or the save handler runs. Only use it for helper/UI-only fields.
- **Use correct property types when overriding `Page`, `Resource`, and `Widget` properties.** These properties have union types or changed modifiers that must be preserved:
  - `$navigationIcon`: `protected static string | BackedEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$navigationGroup`: `protected static string | UnitEnum | null` (not `?string`)
  - `$view`: `protected string` (not `protected static string`) on `Page` and `Widget` classes

=== inertiajs/inertia-laravel rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/Pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-vue-development` when working with Inertia Vue client-side patterns.

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.
